Your feedbacks will always be most welcome!

You can use ready-made structures to build [applications for websites](https://github.com/aplus-framework/app),
[APIs and microservices](https://github.com/aplus-framework/one). Or build your own structures!

If you are looking for stability, we offer [**LTS**](https://aplus-framework.com/lts) versions of the framework.

All libraries are [tested daily](https://status.aplus-framework.com/) to ensure that everything is working correctly.

If you use a modern PHP editor, you will see how productive it is to work with the Aplus Framework.

We put links to RFCs, [documentation](https://docs.aplus-framework.com/) and articles that aid in learning and development.

Codes are tested with Quality Tools, have PHPDocs and friendly interfaces that help autocomplete.

And much more!
